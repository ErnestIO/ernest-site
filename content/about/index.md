# About Ernest

### Ernest makes it easier to develop and deploy applications in the Cloud. Ernest supports full-stack application orchestration that allows you to drive software and infrastructure as a unified system

---

Ernest was created by R3 Labs. We are developers, systems people and entrepreneurs based in London, Barcelona, and Tortosa who are passionate about the power of automation and the cloud. We built our first clouds ten years ago, we've delivered complex critical web systems and we've built and sold technology businesses. Now we are tackling tooling that frees developers to just build.
