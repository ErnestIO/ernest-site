A firewall rule controls traffic that is allowed to flow between both internal and external routers and networks.

**networks**

A network is a virtual network that attaches to a router (in vcloud, other providers will differ). This is what allows us to network/isolate VM’s together.

 * This field is mandatory.
 * This field cannot be null or empty.
 * This field must be unique for this user & all the networks on the manifest.

 * This field is optional.
 * This field can be empty and it will default to ["8.8.8.8", "4.4.4.4"].

**port_forwarding**

A port forward is something that converts translates a request on a port from one IP to another on a different network. Only tcp port forwarding is supported.

* **from_port**
 * Source port numbers
 * Values can be:  an string ( valid port number, 1 - 65535 ) or any

 * It must follow CIDR notation as described at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing 
 * This field is optional.
 * This field can be null or empty, in case a router is created by Ernest it will default to the created one, on the other hand this value will be used.
 * This field must be unique for this user & all the networks on the manifest.
