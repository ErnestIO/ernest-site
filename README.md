# ernest.io

The ernest.io site is based on the [Hugo Bootstrap Premium theme](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-bootstrap-premium), and takes inspiration from the [nats.io site](http://nats.io).

## Contributing Content

If you would like to contribute code to Ernest please follow the standard Fork-and-Branch GitHub workflow. If you're not familiar with this process please read the following guides:

* ['Forking Projects' GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

* ['Fork a Repo' GitHub Help article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

We will review and discuss with you any contributions or corrections submitted via GitHub Pull Request.

## Checking Your Work

To make sure your changes render correctly, you can build and preview the site on your local system using Hugo. 

**Note 1:** On OS X, if you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), installation is even easier: just run brew install hugo.

**Note 2:** Hugo requires Go 1.4+. If Go is not already installed on your system, you can [get it here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Now install Hugo:

```
go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo
```

Clone your forked copy of the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GIT USERNAME>/ernest-site.git
```

Change to the directory:

```
cd ernest-site/
```

Build the site and start the server:

```
hugo server -w
```

The `-w` switch starts Hugo in live preview mode, so you can see your updated content and layout in real time as you edit.
